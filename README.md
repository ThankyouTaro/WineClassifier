# WineClassifier
Final project for BigData in Media course at KTH  
A CNN model and SVM model were implemented in this project.  
To run the code, we used Python 3.10.9, and following packages are required:  
sklearn  
nympy  
pandas  
torch  
torchvision  
matplot  
Python  
Run svm.py for the SVM model and train.py for CNN model  
Replace "linear" of svm into "poly", "rbf", "sigmoid" can change the kernel of SVM model  
Replace resnet18 with resnet34, resnet50, resnet101 can change the type of CNN model.
